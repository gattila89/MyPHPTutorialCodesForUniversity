# MyPHPTutorialCodesForUniversity
 This is a repository for my tutorials of my subject of "Internet Application Development II" - PHP tutorials

Hello!
If you want to test or use this codes, here are some infos...
First of all, I have used the wampserver program to run my php code. This program is free and you can install it from here:
https://www.wampserver.com/
You have to copy all the files in the "www" folder of the wamp64 program. If your wampserver is good configured, you shouldn't be have problem.

Sorry, but i had to write the ui in hungarian...
